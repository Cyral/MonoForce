MonoForce UI
========

![Logo](https://github.com/Cyral/MonoForce/blob/mono/Assets/Logo.png)

An up to date, MonoGame based, improved version of [Neoforce Controls](https://github.com/NeoforceControls/XNA) by [WillHuxtable](https://github.com/WillHuxtable) and Myself.

The MonoForce solution contains a MonoGame version of Neoforce controls, as well as an identical demo to the original XNA version.

The XNA version is used for compiling the assets, but everything will work with MonoGame once the skins are compiled.

Linux support is currently being worked on.

###What's New?
- **Documentation:** MonoForce includes comments from the commented version of Neoforce by Mike Kukta.
- **Smooth skin:** The default skin used has a smoother look than the original.
- Variable font size for labels.
- Support for color codes. Example: `[color:Red]Red Text![/color]`
- **Controls:** A new file dialog control, color slider, and message box creator.
- Tooltip fade in and fade out.
- Improvements to the console, such as pressing "up" to scroll through the history.
